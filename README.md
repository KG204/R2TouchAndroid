Source Control for R2 Touch Android

Certain image files have been removed to prevent someone from completely copying the project
until I get permission from the original creator to share those image files
These files are:
the brown and blue wireframe background
R2 wireframe
Sound wheel with all the different options highlighted (some still exist to show how it works)

Image files related to how the source code behaves (such as the color palette images) have
been left alone, as well as images that are simple in design
